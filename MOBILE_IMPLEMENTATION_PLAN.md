   - **Fallback**: Use existing React Native SMS libraries as interim solution

2. **Background Processing Limitations**
   - **Risk**: Android background restrictions may limit functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Research WorkManager and background task best practices
   - **Fallback**: Reduce to foreground-only sync with clear user communication

3. **Device Compatibility**
   - **Risk**: SMS handling varies significantly between Android OEMs
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing on different devices and OS versions
   - **Fallback**: Graceful degradation for unsupported features

4. **Play Store Approval**
   - **Risk**: SMS/Phone permissions are heavily scrutinized
   - **Mitigation**: Clear privacy policy, proper permission justification
   - **Fallback**: Internal distribution while addressing Play Store feedback

### Medium-Risk Items

1. **Performance with Large Message Volumes**
   - **Mitigation**: Implement pagination and caching early in development

2. **WebSocket Connection Reliability**  
   - **Mitigation**: Robust reconnection logic and offline handling
