# Expo Go vs Development Build - Important!

## 🚨 Your App Cannot Run in Expo Go!

Your app uses **native modules** that Expo Go doesn't support:
- ❌ `react-native-get-sms-android` - SMS reading/sending
- ❌ SMS permissions
- ❌ Native device features

## ✅ Solution: Use Your Development Build APK

You **already built** a working APK! Use it:

### Download Your APK:
```
https://expo.dev/accounts/zainafzal/projects/google-messages-mobile/builds/338d3c62-5bc3-4a44-b21c-947ebb85b93f
```

### Install on Your Phone:
1. Download the APK (~168 MB)
2. Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"
3. Install the APK
4. Open the app
5. **All SMS features work!** ✅

## 📊 Comparison

| Feature | Expo Go | Development Build APK |
|---------|---------|----------------------|
| **SMS Reading** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Works |
| **SMS Sending** | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Works |
| **SMS Permissions** | ❌ Cannot request | ✅ Works |
| **QR Scanning** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **UI/Navigation** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **WebSocket Sync** | ✅ Works | ✅ Works |
| **Install Size** | ~50 MB | ~168 MB (dev) |
| **Rebuild Required** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (when adding native modules) |

---

## 🎯 Current Code State

I've **temporarily disabled** SMS code so you can:
- ✅ See the UI in Expo Go
- ✅ Test navigation
- ✅ View layouts
- ❌ But SMS features won't work

### To Enable Full Features:

**In `app/_layout.tsx`:**
```typescript
// UNCOMMENT these lines:
const hasPermissions = await smsService.requestPermissions();
const deviceInfo = await getDeviceInfo();
socketService.initialize(deviceInfo);
```

**In `app/index.tsx`:**
```typescript
// UNCOMMENT these lines:
const convs = await smsService.getConversations();
setConversations(convs);
```

Then **rebuild APK**:
```bash
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

## 🚀 Recommended Workflow

### For UI Development:
1. Use **Expo Go** for quick UI testing
2. No rebuild needed
3. Fast iteration
4. Limited to UI/navigation only

### For Full Testing:
1. Use **Development Build APK**
2. All features work
3. SMS reading/sending works
4. Rebuild when adding native modules

### For Production:
1. Build **Production APK**
   ```bash
   eas build --profile production-apk --platform android
   ```
2. Much smaller size (25-40 MB)
3. Share with users

---

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Test in Expo Go (UI Only):
```bash
cd mobile
npm start
# Scan QR with Expo Go app
```

### Build Development APK (Full Features):
```bash
cd mobile
eas build --profile development --platform android
```

### Build Production APK (Optimized):
```bash
cd mobile
eas build --profile production-apk --platform android
```

## 💡 Why Expo Go Doesn't Support Native Modules

**Expo Go** is a pre-built app with a fixed set of libraries. It cannot:
- ❌ Read SMS (requires native code)
- ❌ Access SMS database (Android system permission)
- ❌ Use custom native modules

**Development Build** compiles your native code:
- ✅ Includes `react-native-get-sms-android`
- ✅ Links native libraries
- ✅ Supports all permissions
- ✅ Custom native modules work

---

## 📱 What You Can Test Now

### In Expo Go (Current):
- ✅ UI Design (pixel-perfect Google Messages)
- ✅ Navigation (Inbox → Chat → Compose)
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Loading states
- ✅ Empty states
- ✅ Mock conversations display

### In Development Build APK:
- ✅ Everything above, plus:
- ✅ **Real SMS reading**
- ✅ **Real SMS sending**
- ✅ **Contact integration**
- ✅ **Permission handling**
- ✅ **QR code pairing with web**
- ✅ **Real-time message sync**

---

## 🎯 Current Mock Data

The code now shows **demo conversations** in Expo Go:

```typescript
Demo Contact: +1234567890
"This is a demo conversation. Install the development build APK to see real SMS!"
```

This lets you:
- See the UI layout
- Test navigation
- Verify designs
- Check animations

**But it's not real SMS data!**

---

## ✅ Summary

| What You Want | What to Use |
|---------------|-------------|
| Quick UI testing | **Expo Go** (current state) |
| Full SMS features | **Development Build APK** (already built) |
| Share with users | **Production APK** (build when ready) |
| Google Play Store | **Production AAB** (build for store) |

---

## 🚀 Next Step

**Download and install your development build APK:**

```
https://expo.dev/accounts/zainafzal/projects/google-messages-mobile/builds/338d3c62-5bc3-4a44-b21c-947ebb85b93f
```

Then **uncomment the SMS code** in `_layout.tsx` and `index.tsx` and rebuild!

## 📞 Common Questions

**Q: Can I make Expo Go support SMS?**  
A: No, it's technically impossible. Use a development build instead.

**Q: Do I need to rebuild every time?**  
A: No! Only when:
- Adding new native modules
- Changing `app.json` significantly
- Upgrading Expo SDK

**Q: How long does a build take?**  
A: 5-10 minutes on EAS (cloud build)

**Q: Can I build locally without EAS?**  
A: Yes! Install Android Studio and run:
```bash
npx expo run:android
```

Your app is ready! Just use the **development build APK** for full features! 🎉
