# Fixes Applied to Google Messages App

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document outlines all the fixes applied to resolve the three reported issues with the Google Messages mobile app.

---

## Issue 1: Loading State Not Clearing After SMS Send ✅ FIXED

### Problem
The UI showed "sending..." indefinitely after sending a message, even after the message was successfully sent.

### Root Cause
The `isSending` state was only being cleared in the `finally` block of the send function, but the actual SMS status updates come asynchronously through the status listener callback. This created a timing issue where the state would clear before the message was actually confirmed as sent.

### Solution Applied
**File: `app/chat/[id].tsx`**

1. **Enhanced status listener callback** to clear `isSending` state when message is confirmed sent, delivered, or failed:
   ```typescript
   // Clear sending state when message is confirmed sent or failed
   if (status === 'sent' || status === 'delivered' || status === 'failed') {
     setIsSending(false);
     console.log('Message status updated, isSending set to false');
   }
   ```

2. **Added logging** to track state changes:
   ```typescript
   } finally {
     // Always clear sending state
     setIsSending(false);
     console.log('Send complete, isSending set to false');
   }
   ```

This ensures the loading state is cleared both immediately after the send operation completes AND when the native status callback confirms the message status.

## Issue 2: Keyboard Hides Send Button on Compose Screen ✅ FIXED

### Problem
When the keyboard appears in the compose message screen, the send button was hidden/pushed off-screen, making it impossible to send messages.

### Root Cause
The compose screen layout did not properly handle keyboard appearance. The UI needed `KeyboardAvoidingView` to adjust the layout when the keyboard opens.

### Solution Applied
**File: `app/compose.tsx`**

1. **Added KeyboardAvoidingView import**:
   ```typescript
   import { View, FlatList, StyleSheet, TouchableOpacity, Image, KeyboardAvoidingView, Platform } from 'react-native';
   ```

2. **Wrapped the entire screen content** in `KeyboardAvoidingView`:
   ```typescript
   return (
     <KeyboardAvoidingView 
       style={styles.container}
       behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : 'height'}
       keyboardVerticalOffset={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 90 : 0}
     >
       {/* Screen content */}
     </KeyboardAvoidingView>
   );
   ```

3. **Platform-specific behavior**:
   - iOS: Uses `'padding'` behavior with 90px vertical offset
   - Android: Uses `'height'` behavior with no offset

4. **Android-specific improvements** (also applied to chat screen):
   - Wrapped content in proper container/KeyboardAvoidingView hierarchy
   - Leverages `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustResize"` already in AndroidManifest.xml
   - Input and send button properly stay above keyboard, just like Google Messages
   
This ensures the send button and input field remain visible and accessible when the keyboard is open on both platforms, with Android specifically handling keyboard appearance like the native Google Messages app.

## Issue 3: New Messages Not Syncing Automatically ✅ FIXED

### Problem
New sent or received messages did not show in the app until manually refreshed. Messages received through the Android broadcast receiver were not being propagated to the React Native UI in real-time.

### Root Cause
While the native Android layer (`SmsReceiver.kt`) was already emitting events for incoming SMS messages, the React Native app wasn't listening to these events. There was no centralized mechanism to handle real-time SMS updates across different screens.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Created SMS Listener Hook
**File: `src/hooks/useSmsListener.ts` (NEW)**

Created a reusable React hook that listens to SMS events from the native Android layer:

```typescript
export function useSmsListener(options: UseSmsListenerOptions) {
  const { onSmsReceived, onSmsSent, onSmsDelivered } = options;
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Set up event listeners for SMS events from native layer
    const subscriptions = [];
    
    if (onSmsReceived) {
      const subscription = DeviceEventEmitter.addListener(
        'onSmsReceived',
        (event: SmsReceivedEvent) => {
          onSmsReceived(event);
        }
      );
      subscriptions.push(subscription);
    }
    // ... similar for onSmsSent and onSmsDelivered
    
    return () => {
      subscriptions.forEach(sub => sub.remove());
    };
  }, [onSmsReceived, onSmsSent, onSmsDelivered]);
}
```

**Features:**
- Listens to three event types: `onSmsReceived`, `onSmsSent`, `onSmsDelivered`
- Automatic cleanup on unmount
- Type-safe event interfaces
- Console logging for debugging

#### 2. Updated Chat Screen for Real-Time Sync
**File: `app/chat/[id].tsx`**

Added real-time SMS listening to the chat screen:

```typescript
// Handle incoming SMS messages in real-time
useSmsListener({
  onSmsReceived: useCallback((event) => {
    // Only process messages from this conversation
    if (event.phoneNumber === phoneNumber) {
      console.log('New message received for this chat:', event.body);
      
      // Add new message to the list immediately
      const newMessage: Message = {
        id: `msg_${event.timestamp}`,
        conversationId: phoneNumber,
        phoneNumber: event.phoneNumber,
        body: event.body,
        timestamp: event.timestamp,
        type: 'received',
        read: false,
      };
      
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, newMessage]);
      
      // Sync to socket
      if (socketService.connected) {
        socketService.syncMessages([newMessage]);
      }
    }
  }, [phoneNumber]),
});
```

**Benefits:**
- New messages appear instantly in the chat without refresh
- Messages are filtered to only show relevant conversation
- Syncs to web client via socket if connected
- Optimistic UI update for instant feedback

#### 3. Updated Inbox Screen for Real-Time Sync
**File: `app/index.tsx`**

Replaced the old event listener implementation with the new hook:

```typescript
// Handle incoming SMS messages in real-time
useSmsListener({
  onSmsReceived: useCallback((event) => {
    console.log('New SMS received in inbox:', event.phoneNumber);
    // Reload conversations to show new message
    loadConversations();
  }, []),
});
```

**Benefits:**
- Conversation list updates immediately when new SMS arrives
- No need to manually refresh to see new conversations
- Cleaner code with centralized event handling

#### 4. Native Layer (Already Implemented)
**File: `android/app/src/main/java/com/googlemessages/app/SmsReceiver.kt`**

The native Android `SmsReceiver` was already in place and working correctly:
- Listens to `SMS_DELIVER_ACTION` broadcast
- Extracts message details (sender, body, timestamp)
- Emits `onSmsReceived` event to React Native
- Shows notification for new messages

---

## Issue 4: Sync Issues - Sent Messages Not Appearing in List ✅ FIXED

### Problem
1. After successfully sending messages, they don't appear in the conversation list (inbox)
2. When opening a conversation, unread messages are not marked as read
3. Unread count badges don't update properly

### Root Cause
1. **Inbox not refreshing**: The inbox screen wasn't refreshing when returning from sending a message
2. **Mark as read not implemented**: The `markAsRead` function was a placeholder and didn't actually update message status
3. **No focus listener**: Inbox didn't reload when screen regained focus after sending messages

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Implemented Native Mark As Read
**File: `android/app/src/main/java/com/googlemessages/app/EnhancedSmsManager.kt`**

Added `markConversationAsRead` method that directly updates the SMS database:
```kotlin
@ReactMethod
fun markConversationAsRead(phoneNumber: String, promise: Promise) {
    val contentResolver = reactContext.contentResolver
    val values = ContentValues()
    values.put(Telephony.Sms.READ, 1)
    values.put(Telephony.Sms.SEEN, 1)
    
    // Update all unread messages from this phone number
    val selection = "${Telephony.Sms.ADDRESS} = ? AND ${Telephony.Sms.READ} = ?"
    val selectionArgs = arrayOf(phoneNumber, "0")
    
    val updated = contentResolver.update(
        Telephony.Sms.CONTENT_URI,
        values,
        selection,
        selectionArgs
    )
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Direct database update (fast and reliable)
- Updates both READ and SEEN fields
- Only updates unread messages (efficient)

#### 2. Implemented JS Mark As Read with Fallback
**File: `src/services/smsService.ts`**

Enhanced `markAsRead` method:
```typescript
async markAsRead(phoneNumber: string): Promise<void> {
  // First try native module (most efficient)
  if (EnhancedSmsManager && EnhancedSmsManager.markConversationAsRead) {
    await EnhancedSmsManager.markConversationAsRead(phoneNumber);
    return;
  }
  
  // Fallback: Use SmsAndroid to mark individual messages
  const messages = await this.readConversationMessages(phoneNumber);
  const unreadMessages = messages.filter(msg => !msg.read && msg.type === 'received');
  
  for (const message of unreadMessages) {
    await SmsAndroid.markAsRead(message.id);
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Tries native method first (fast)
- Falls back to individual message updates if needed
- Only processes unread received messages

#### 3. Auto-Mark As Read When Opening Chat
**File: `app/chat/[id].tsx`**

Added automatic mark as read when conversation opens:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  loadMessages();
  loadContactInfo();
  loadSimInfo();
  
  // Mark conversation as read when opening
  markConversationAsRead();
}, [phoneNumber]);

const markConversationAsRead = async () => {
  await smsService.markAsRead(phoneNumber);
  // Notify web client if connected
  if (socketService.connected) {
    socketService.emit('conversation:read', { phoneNumber });
  }
};
```

**Benefits:**
- Messages marked as read immediately upon opening
- Unread badges cleared
- Web client notified in real-time

#### 4. Auto-Refresh Inbox on Focus
**File: `app/index.tsx`**

Added focus listener to refresh when returning to inbox:
```typescript
import { useFocusEffect } from 'expo-router';

// Refresh conversations when screen comes into focus
useFocusEffect(
  useCallback(() => {
    if (hasPermissions) {
      console.log('Inbox screen focused, refreshing conversations...');
      loadConversations();
    }
  }, [hasPermissions])
);
```

**Benefits:**
- Inbox refreshes when navigating back from chat
- Shows newly sent messages immediately
- Updates unread counts after marking messages as read
- No manual refresh needed

#### 5. Emit Events After Sending
**File: `app/chat/[id].tsx`**

Added event emission after sending messages:
```typescript
setTimeout(() => {
  loadMessages();
  // Emit event so inbox can refresh
  socketService.emit('message:sent', { phoneNumber, messageId });
}, 1500);
```

**Benefits:**
- Web client receives immediate notification
- Could be used to trigger inbox refresh
- Better sync across all clients

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

### Dependencies
No new dependencies added. All fixes use existing libraries:
- `react-native` core APIs
- Existing native modules (`EnhancedSmsManager`, `SmsReceiver`)

### Performance Impact
- **Positive**: Less manual refreshing means fewer unnecessary data fetches
- **Minimal overhead**: Event listeners are lightweight and properly cleaned up
- **Better UX**: Instant updates improve perceived performance

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Next Steps
1. **Optimistic updates for sent messages**: Show messages immediately in inbox before native confirmation
2. **Message delivery status**: Use `onSmsDelivered` event to show delivery receipts
3. **Background sync**: Continue listening even when app is in background
4. **Batch updates**: Group multiple incoming messages to reduce re-renders
5. **Message deduplication**: Prevent duplicate messages if both socket and native events fire

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If loading state still gets stuck:
1. Check native logs: `adb logcat | grep EnhancedSmsManager`
2. Verify status listener is registered before sending
3. Check that message IDs are unique and properly tracked

### If keyboard still hides button:
1. Verify device uses standard keyboard (some custom keyboards behave differently)
2. Check screen orientation (may need different offsets for landscape)
3. Try adjusting `keyboardVerticalOffset` value

### If messages don't sync:
1. Verify SMS permissions are granted
2. Check that app is set as default SMS app (required for receiving broadcasts)
3. Check native logs: `adb logcat | grep SmsReceiver`
4. Verify React Native event bridge is working: Check for event subscription in logs
